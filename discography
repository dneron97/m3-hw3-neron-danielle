    Taylor has recorded nine 9 original albums. 
    A few of them are Fearless, Lover, 1989, and Folklore. Fearless, Lover, and 1989 are all pop. 
    Folklore was released in 2020, which ended up being very successful. 
    It is Alternative/indie, which is something new. 
    I ended up loving the album, and I listened to it profusely during quarantine. My favorite song is Exile!
